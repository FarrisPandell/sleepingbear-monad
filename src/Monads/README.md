# SleepingBear.Monads.Monads

The class library provides implementations of the `Maybe` and `Result` monads along with various helper and extension
methods. The implementations are based on the Scott Wlaschin talks about functional programming and the "Functional
Programming in C#, 2nd Edition" book by Enrico Buonanno.
